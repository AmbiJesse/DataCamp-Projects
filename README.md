## 🐍 Guided projects using python

### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
The average movie duration suggested movies have been getting shorter in the past ten years.
- Subsetted and explored the data with scatter plots
- Filtered for durations < 60 mins; revealed items such as 'documentary' and 'stand-up'
- Used for-loop to color code non-typical movies; passed back into scatter plot
- Non-typical movies cluster around the bottom; cannot conclude that movies are getting shorter
