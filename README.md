## 🐍 Guided projects using Python

### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
The average movie duration suggested movies have been getting shorter in the past ten years.
- Subsetted and explored the data with scatter plots
- Filtered for durations < 60 mins; revealed items such as 'documentary' and 'stand-up'
- Used for-loop to color code non-typical movies; passed back into scatter plot
- Non-typical movies cluster around the bottom; cannot conclude that movies are getting shorter

### 3. Real-time Insights from Social Media Data
- Imported and cleaned JSON files containing API snapshots of Twitter data
- Performed frequency analysis on users and hashtags
- Manipulated data to visualize retweets to understand tweet popularity and impact
- Deduced 'category' of people interested in trending topics, who most impacts the rise of hashtag popularity and the difference in impact between followers and engagement

## 📊 Guided projects using SQL

### 1. Analyze International Debt Statistics
- Used aggregate functions, alisasing, filtering techniques, and sorting to answer questions such as which country owes the most debt and what is average debt across different indicators.

`SUM()` `MAX()` `WHERE` `GROUP BY` `ORDER BY` `LIMIT`
